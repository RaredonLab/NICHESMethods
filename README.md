# NICHESMethods

This repository is a collection point for actively-developing methods associated with NICHES.

For those who are here for in-development visualization and analysis tools, 'ToolBuilding' has most of the good stuff. I will try to update regularly as these functions become more formalized for general use.

All of the scripts within this repository are unpublished. If you end up using scripts from this package for publication, please cite: [10.1093/bioinformatics/btac775](https://doi.org/10.1093/bioinformatics/btac775)
