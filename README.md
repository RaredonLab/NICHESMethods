# NICHESMethods

This repository is a collection point for actively-developing methods associated with NICHES.

Developing analysis and visualization tools are stored in 'ToolBuilding'. These are being shared here in a communal setting so that people can learn different ways of exploring and leveraging NICHES data. 

However, all of the scripting in this repository is original, unpublished work, spanning several projects. Please do not leverage these scripts for publication without checking with Dr. Raredon directly first, so that embargoes can be identified & respected and all relevant authors can be credited as appropriate.

The original NICHES publication and associated supplemental materials are here: [10.1093/bioinformatics/btac775](https://doi.org/10.1093/bioinformatics/btac775)
"Comprehensive visualization of cellâ€“cell interactions in single-cell and spatial transcriptomics with NICHES"
