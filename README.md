This repository is a collection point for actively-developing methods associated with NICHES.

Developing analysis and visualization tools are stored in 'ToolBuilding'. Updated as functions grow more generalized.

All of the scripts within this repository are unpublished. If you end up using scripts from this package for publication, please cite: [10.1093/bioinformatics/btac775](https://doi.org/10.1093/bioinformatics/btac775)
