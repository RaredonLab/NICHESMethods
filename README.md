This repository is a collection point for actively-developing methods associated with NICHES.

All of the scripting in this repository is original and unpublished. These scripts are presented here for teaching and learning purposes only.

Please do not use or modify these scripts for publication without checking directly with Dr. Raredon first, so that embargoes can be identified & respected and all contributing authors can be credited.

Two functions in particular, NICHES_FeaturePlot and CircuitPlot, are currently under embargo until further notice. Please do not use these for publication.

The original NICHES publication and associated supplemental materials are here: [10.1093/bioinformatics/btac775](https://doi.org/10.1093/bioinformatics/btac775)
